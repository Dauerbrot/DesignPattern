/**
 * The purpose of the builder pattern is based on the open-closed-principle.
 * While the object can get new attributes, we donÂ´t need to modify the
 * constructor of the object which is build. for example the hero class.
 *
 * In a classic way the hero class had a constructor with all available attributes and maybe some
 * overloaded constructor to initialize the class with a bare minimum.
 *
 * With every new attribute the interface provides, we have to introduce a new parameter in an existing
 * constructor and this can be ugly...
 * e.g. new HeroImpl(param1 , param2, param3, param4, param5, param6, param7,...) and so on
 * So the complete construct has to be extended in every class, which create a new instance of HeroImpl
 * or who implements the interface Hero.
 *
 * DRY is the key. The Idea just to extend the builder and use it, if needed, the new method on the given position.
